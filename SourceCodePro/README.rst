Source Code Pro is a set of monospaced OpenType fonts that have been
designed to work well in coding environments. This family of fonts is
a complementary design to the Source Sans family.

Sauce Code Powerline is derived from Source Code Pro for Powerline
users. The Powerline symbols is being made by Kim Silkebækken. The
patch work is being undertaken by Carl X. Su. The Italics were later
added to the family and patched by Anwar. The updated versions of the
non italics variants were also patched by him.

to produce the font family are distributed under an open licence and
